# 31horrors

*4/20/23*: I built this website before I even really knew what JavaScript and HTML were, and haven't (and probably won't) updated since then. Just something to be aware of when you recoil in horror at the code...

31horrors.com is a website I built for my wife. It's largely experimiental and super basic right now, but 
I plan to rebuild it in the future. Check it out at [31horrors.com](https://31horrors.com).
